## USB Commnunication

Use this Repo to start USB Communication, in this example the GUID in de `const.pas` is used to get all USB devices connection to the system

If you want to use a different device type, change the GUID (most of them are in de unit file)

Next you van use the `USB.pas` unit to set up the communication.
